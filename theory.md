## Supervised machine learning

## Validation

> What is overfitting? 👶

When your model perform very well on your training set but can't generalize the test set, because it adjusted a lot to the training set.

> How to validate your models? 👶

Answer here

> Why do we need to split our data into three parts: train, validation, and test? 👶

Answer here

> Can you explain how cross-validation works? 👶

Cross-validation is the process to separate your total training set into two subsets: training and validation set, and evaluate your model to choose the hyperparameters. But you do this process iteratively, selecting differents training and validation set, in order to reduce the bias that you would have by selecting only one validation set.

Answer here

> Is logistic regression a linear model? Why? 👶

Answer here

> What is sigmoid? What does it do? 👶

Answer here

> How do we evaluate classification models? 👶

There are multiple evaluation metrics we can use. Here are a few, categorical cross-entropy (lower is better), AUC (binary classification), Precision-Recall or even accuracy. 

> What is accuracy? 👶

Accuracy is a metric for evaluating classification models. It is calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions by the number of total predictions.

> Is accuracy always a good metric? 👶

Accuracy is not a good performance metric when there is imbalance in the dataset. For example, in binary classification with 95% of A class and 5% of B class, prediction accuracy can be 95%. In case of imbalance dataset, we need to choose Precision, recall, or F1 Score depending on the problem we are trying to solve. 

> What is the confusion table? What are the cells in this table? 👶

Confusion matrix depicts how many True positives (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) model has made. Most of the performance metrics are based on confusion matrix. It is used for classification problem and can be used for more than two classes.

Confusion matrix  =>


||                |     Actual   |        Actual |
|:---:|   :---:        |     :---:    |:---:          |
||                | Positive (1) | Negative (0)  |
|Predicted|   Positive (1) | TP           | FP            |
|Predicted|   Negative (0) | FN           | TN            |

True Positives (TP): When the actual class of the observation is 1(True) and the prediction is 1(True)

True Negative (TN): When the actual class of the observation is 0(False) and the prediction is 0(False)

False Positive (FP): When the actual class of the observation is 0(False) and the prediction is 1(True)

False Negative (FN): When the actual class of the observation is 1(True) and the prediction is 0(False)


> What is precision, recall, and F1-score? 👶

Precision and recall are classification evaluation metrics:

P = TP / (TP + FP) and R = TP / (TP + FN).

Where TP is true positives, FP is false positives and FN is false negatives

In both cases the score of 1 is the best: we get no false positives or false negatives and only true positives.

F1 is a combination of both precision and recall in one score:

F1 = 2 * PR / (P + R). 

Max F score is 1 and min is 0, with 1 being the best.
